The first release candidate of Xarray v0.10 was released today. The release
includes more than five months of work and contributions from more than 28
contributors, many of whom are part of the Pangeo community.

The release includes numerous new features, performance improvements, and bug fixes.
Full details of the release can be found in the [Xarray documentation](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/v0.10.0rc1/whats-new.html).

### Highlights include:

- Indexing now supports broadcasting over dimensions, similar to NumPyâ€™s
  vectorized indexing (but better!).
- `resample()` has a new groupby-like API like pandas. Of particular note, Xarray's
  resample tools now also support up- and down-sampling.
- `apply_ufunc()` facilitates wrapping and parallelizing functions written for
  NumPy arrays.
- Performance improvements, particularly for `dask` and `open_mfdataset()`.

We're excited for the Pangeo community to test out this release candidate and
encourage users to report any [issues on GitHub](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/issues).
If all goes well, the final v0.10.0 release will come out in about a week.

To install, use:

```pip install --pre --upgrade --upgrade-strategy=only-if-needed xarray```
